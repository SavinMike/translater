quiz_intro	How to use the dialect guessing quiz	
quiz_intro_description	In order to find your dialect, the app needs information about your pronunciation of certain words.\n\nThe app asks you how you say 26 different words. Some of the words have different pronunciations – you can listen to the different options. For each word, choose the word, phrase or pronunciation that is most like the one you use when talking to your friends. Have a look at all the options for each word before you choose.\n\nPlease note:\n\n1). You might not find your exact pronunciation of some of the words on the app. Don’t worry, just choose the one that is closest to the one you use.\n\n2). The app compares your pronunciation with elderly people whose dialects were studied over 50 years ago in the Survey of English Dialects. So the app’s guess might not be very good because language has changed a lot since then. BUT if you tell us which accent you speak at the end of the quiz, your answers can be used to make the app better in the future.
